= Trivy Vulnerability Explorer

Large https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues[Trivy] reports tend to become hard to grasp, that is why this project was created. It is a web application that allows to load a https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues[Trivy] report in json format and displays the vulnerabilities of a single target in an interactive data table.

== Usage

Head over to the https://dbsystel.github.io/trivy-vulnerability-explorer[application^] and load a Trivy report .json file. For example, to scan an outdated alpine image, you can run the following command to create an `alpine-3.9.2.json` report.

----
trivy i -f json alpine:3.9.2 > alpine-3.9.2.json
----

Now load this file in the vulnerability explorer and start exploring. You can filter by term or click one of the categories in the filter bar to dig into the data.

The data never leaves your browser, because all processing is handled inside your browser. Of course you can feel free to fork this project and deploy your own version. If you do so, I would be happy if you leave me a comment and a star on the repository.
